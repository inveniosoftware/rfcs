# <RFC title>

## Summary

> One paragraph explanation of the feature.

## Motivation

> Why are we doing this? What user stories does it support? What is the expected outcome?

- As a ..., I want to ..., so that I ... .

## Detailed design

> This is the bulk of the RFC.

> Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with the framework to understand, and for somebody familiar with the implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be defined here.

## Example

> Show a concrete example of what the RFC implies. This will make the consequences of adopting the RFC much clearer.

> As with other sections, use it if it makes sense for your RFC.

## How we teach this

> What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? How is this idea best presented? As a continuation of existing Invenio patterns, or as a wholly new one?

> Would the acceptance of this proposal mean the Invenio documentation must be re-organized or altered? Does it change how Invenio is taught to new users at any level?

> How should this feature be introduced and taught to existing Invenio users?

## Drawbacks

> Why should we *not* do this? Please consider the impact on teaching Invenio, on the integration of this feature with other existing and planned features, on the impact of the API churn on existing apps, etc.

> There are tradeoffs to choosing any path, please attempt to identify them here.

## Alternatives

> What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

> This section could also include prior art, that is, how other frameworks in the same domain have solved this problem.

## Unresolved questions

> Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still TBD? Use it as a todo list for the RFC.

## Resources/Timeline

> Which resources do you have available to implement this RFC and what is the overall timeline?
