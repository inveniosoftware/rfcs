# Vocabulary harvesting

![](./0077/upload_7c42e926b06bb2faabca6baf54b80894.jpg)

## Summary

See also [RFC Job system](./rdm-0076-job-system.md)

## Motivation

- As an admin I want to use an admin interface to edit vocabularies
- As an admin, I want to replace a vocabulary item
- As an admin I want to use an admin interface to edit a scheduler for fetching the data
- As an admin I want to control the job schedule
- As an admin I want to be able to update vocabularies from external sources
    - As an admin I want to see the state of such jobs in an administrative dashboard (see logs and general stats as well)
- As a user I want to always use the latest vocabularies
- As a librarian I want to run jobs manually
- As a librarian I want to see the status of runs


### Use cases

- Add a new custom field for a small or large vocabulary:
    - small: the widget should be able to display all possible values (optional: search bar to filter)
    - large: the widget should do a remote search, searching for possible vocabularies
- I should be able to configure the main search and each community search page with new vocabulary's facets.
    - The facet for small vocabularies should display the first top 10*, with a show all button to display all
    - The facet for large vocabularies should display the first top 10* items, and have a search bar to search for more values.
    - 10*: random number, might be more or less


#### CERN Goals

- Update ROR (funder/affiliations), ORCID, grants vocabularies, Import MeSH & CORDIS (needed for HORIZON-ZEN) - in an easily repeatale way
    - => Update a vocabulary term and have it propagate.
    - => Data model fix
- Deposit form auto-completion: Improve indexing of names, grants and affiliations, funders

#### Münster Goals


- Edit persons in the admin interface with direct cataloging to GND authorities
- Harvesting of subjects from GND authorities
- Harvesting Persons from CRIS

#### Example of harvesting sources

- ORCID (Persons)
- ROR (Organisations)
- CRIS (Persons)
- CORDIS
- OpenAIRE projects
- GND Authorities (i.e. Subject Headings, Persons), by OAI-PMH
- Geonames
- MeSH
- CERN databases:
    - List of experiments from GreyBook (https://greybook.cern.ch/) - there is a DB to query
    - Hardcoded list of departments/groups/sections: they may change over time. Old records with old values should keep the old value, even when editing.

#### Examples of admin managed vocabularies

I.e. vocabularies that would be edited by an admin

- Resource types
- Names
- Title types, Date types, Relation types

## Design

### Overview

From a high-level point of view this RFC concerns the following areas:

- **Deposit form (indexing):** Improve search capabilities of names, affiliations/funders and grants (i.e. improve the indexing)
- **Administration interface:** Support for browsing and potentially editing vocabularies
- **Harvesting (ETL)**: APIs and specific harvesting jobs for ROR, ORCID (public dump/data sync), OpenAIRE projects, CORDIS, MeSH, GND Subjecst.
- **Resource, service and data layer**: Support for deprecating/merging of terms, support for managing reindexing of related records.
- **Deployment**: Managing the data model updates for running produciton systems
- **Installation/documentation**: How do InvenioRDM instances configure and manage the harvesters.

The RFC extends the work of [RFC Vocabularies](https://codimd.web.cern.ch/I2ES9IjSRj-WFM2zUC1tKg) and [RFC Relations](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/framework-0040-relations.md). In particular the previous RFC defines:

- Data model of vocabularies - in particular the fieds``identifier``, ``title``, ``description``, ``icon``, ``props``.
- Denormalization of related records - in particular injection of the ``@v`` property and ``indexed_at`` to identify out of sync relations

Priorities:
- The key priority is to ensure CERN/University of Münster is able to regularly update their required vocabularies at the end of the sprint. Thus focus should be on Harvesting and the resource/service/data layer, and the specific jobs themselves.

### Indexing of vocabularies

Current issues include:

- Search for e.g. an organisation name in english/local language does not give good results (e.g. try searching ROR vs our affiliations vocabulary).
- Ranking - often searching e.g. for a name (say Lars Holm Nielsen or Nielsen, Lars Holm) will not yield the name as the top result.
> - Search for organizations doesn't include all possible names https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-rdm-records/issues/933
> - Search for organizations includes withdrawn/inactive organizations that don't show up on normal ROR search. Withdrawn RORs should never be shown, and inactive RORs at a minimum need to be labeled as such.
> - It's difficult to distunguish organizations without country labels https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-rdm-records/issues/1589. Minimally fixed for funders with https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-vocabularies/pull/295
>[name=Tom]

The was some attemps to improve e.g. users search in [inveniosoftware/invenio-users-resources#127](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-users-resources/pull/127)

Tasks:
- Define a couple of tests for each vocabulary.
- Test various approaches to improve results of tes - e.g. better mappings through improved analyzers as well as improved queries.

### Administration interface

- List vocabularies
- CRUD operations for a generic vocabulary
- Search a vocabulary
- CRUD an new entry in a vocabulary (note delete requires specific handling).
- Deprecate an entry
- Propagate changes to related records

#### List vocabularies

#### Search a vocabulary

![](./0077/upload_c8fa3194c384e1e1c78450e2ae200bd9.png)

#### Create a new generic vocabulary


#### Edit an entry

![](./0077/upload_995d234f3af0d610d9347954d3a4eb56.png)

#### Needs

- REST API for listing all vocabularies
- Extend data model to store more information.

### Harvesting jobs

The goals of the harvesting jobs are:

- having autonomous reliable harvesting jobs that can import new entries on a regular basis
- compose harvesting jobs based on ETL-paradigm - e.g. individual parts should be resuable

#### Data streams (ETL)

Describe current work.

#### Logging

The job system will define how to log information (info, warning, errors).

#### Define harvesting jobs

#### Dry-run

- Select the type of Harvester (API, OAI, Dump, ...)
- Edit the harvesters URL/upload dump
- Should we support dry run??

#### Programmatic API

#### Specific jobs

##### ROR

- Access https://zenodo.org/records/11106901
> We should switch to the v2 file and be able to import to both affiliations and funders vocabularies https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-vocabularies/issues/294
>[name=Tom]

##### ORCID

Zenodo - we have requested access to public data sync (requires premium membership)

##### OpenAIRE projects

- Data https://zenodo.org/records/10948409


##### CORDIS

- Access: https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/cordis-eu-research-projects-under-horizon-europe-2021-2027

For each project we need:
- List of organisations
- List of subjects
- Topic (i.e. funding call)
- Dates
- Legal basis
- Description


##### GND Subjects

>- Access: https://services.dnb.de/oai/repository?set=authorities:sachbegriff&verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=MARC21plus-1-xml&from=...&until=...

> The subject itself is available  in datafield 150$a, there are even translations (normally english and french) but as they are not marked as translations they are unusable.

### High-level overview


#### Components

- Harvester
    - Extract (Harvest depending on data source: From API, OAI, Dump...)
    - Transform (Custom transformation Scripts to process data so that is in the right format to be consumed by the yet to be defined vocabularies API)
- Vocabulary management
    - Common loaders per vocab type

## Vocabulary management

#### Data model

```json
{
    "id": "...",
    "title": {
        "en": "...",
        "...": "...",
    },
    "system": {
        "deprecated_by": ["<id>", ... ],
        "deprecated_at": "2024-03-20T12:00:00Z"
    },
    "description": {
        "en": "...",
    },
    "tags": ["deprecated", "depositable", "linkable"],
    "icon": "",
    "type": "languages",
    "props": {
        "<key>": "<value>",
        "datacite_general": "Text",
        "datacite_type": "Article",
    },

}
```

#### Replace item/updating relations

Multi-step operation:
1. when replacing an old value, it should ask for the new value
2. the old value is marked as deprecated (cannot be used for new records)
3. a async task will update all the records that uses the old value (not always the case)
4. the old value can be deleted

#### Updating of relations

## Uni Münster use cases

#### Updating Subjects from GND via OAI-PMH

##### User Stories

- As a user I want to be able to use the newest subjects from GND for tagging my data
- As a systems administrator I want to provide up-to-date subjects vocabulary from the german authority data provider "GND" in the deposit form when creating a new record: ![](./0077/dc7140d5-0907-400a-9515-b339787bdda6.png)
- As an administrator I want to be able to configure a job to update this vocabulary from the XML sources which come over OAI-PMH periodically
    - As a **systems administrator** I want to be able to use the administration interface of InvenioRDM to configure these tasks (when and how often they run, other config) (add this feature in a second phase)
    - ... I want to see logs etc. (this is the same for most of these updating tasks?)
